        I believe in using both analytics and human-centered design to create awesome products. I'm a last semester senior studying <span>Management Information Systems</span> at the <span>University of Houston</span> where I've learned programming and business acumen. My course track is geared towards data analytics, data visualization, and cloud solutions.
        
        <br><br>I've developed a heavy interest in <span>UX design</span> and have taken courses outside of school to learn how to develop interactive prototypes and conduct user research. My knowledge in business, programming, analytics, and design cater to roles where I can use my skills to elevate other innovative thinkers and understand user needs when building new products, features, and experiences. 
        
        <br><br>Other interests I have include psychology, writing, food, nature, tennis, and video games! Feel free to contact me through my email or on LinkedIn.<br><br>
