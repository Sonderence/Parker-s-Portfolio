    <p style="line-height:25px;margin-top:60px;padding-bottom:45px;">Before creating my current portfolio I actually had published a first iteration that failed. It was about a month long process where I would come home every day after my internship and continue my work. I learned a lot about web development in the proccess that I didn't learn in school, so I was exciting to keep moving forward. I figured I could make the site responsive after coding it out, but that ended up being very challenging task.<br><br>I also found out that even though my site looked fine on my desktop, people with smaller screens saw it completely differently. I'm proud of myself for jumping into coding my own portfolio, but I should have learned not just the basics, but the fundamentals and best practices before starting. Feeling frustrated, I almost decided to use a CMS site instead, but I picked myself up and learned how to code using Bootstrap.<br><br>I started from scratch again and made sure I would have a mobile first mindset the second time around. Three days of hard work later, I now have a portfolio that doesn't ignore one of the most important areas of technology. This was a huge lesson in mobile first design and it humbled me greatly. I poured a lot in creating this site, so hope you like it!</p>
