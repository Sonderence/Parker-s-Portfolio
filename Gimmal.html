<p>
<b>Overview</b><br>
At Gimmal I was tasked with leading the re-design of Gimmal's product documentation. This included designing a new navigation structure, migrating content to a new host platform, and styling/editing the copy. I also proposed integration of the doc site into the IT support platform.<br><br>
    In addition to the doc site project I also wrote a technical blog series, won the social media contest, attended marketing meetings, and presented my final output with the executive leadership team.

<h1>Research and Preparation</h1> 
 
<div class="paligo">
<h2>Paligo</h2>
<p>Gimmal wanted to re-design and migrate all doc site content from the current host platform to Paligo. I was given two days to learn how to use the Paligo software before diving in. I took this time to understand how to create a navigation strucuture, separate topics, and style content.</p>  
     </div>
 
<div class="painpoints">
<h2>User Paint Points</h2>
     <p>User research was done to identify user pain points before I started at Gimmal, so we would know what problems needed to be addressed.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Users have trouble finding content.</li> 
        <li>It takes too many clicks to get to content.</li>
        <li>The user might not know website URL.</li> 
        <li>Generally there is only one way to navigate.</li> 
        <li>The flowcharts and images were not styled or were dated.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
     
<div class="empathy">
<h2>Empathy Map</h2>
     <p>I decided to create an empathy map based on these pain points, so I could understand the user better. This served as a mental model that would remind me of the overall goal.</p> 
    <img src="https://sonderence.github.io/parkerwright.me/images/empathymap.png">
     </div>
     
<div class="compete">
<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>   
     <p>We looked at the documentation of large tech companies for design inspiration. We liked the layout of Microsoft's documentation, because they have many products and succesfully created a simple navigation structure for the user.</p>
     </div>
     
<h1>User Experience</h1>
     
<div class="oandg">  
<h2>Objectives and Guidelines</h2>
    <p>I determined the objectives that would improve the user expereince and the guidelines I would follow and remind myself of when making decisions.<br><br>
    <b>Objectives</b><br>
        Condense and simplify page structure<br>
        Create a logical topic organization<br>
        Decrease cognitive load<br>
        Make site more accessable<br><br>
        <b>Design Guidelines</b><br>
        Simplicity<br>
        Consistency<br>
        Flexibility<br>
        Clarity
</p>
     </div>
     
<div class="process">
<h2>Process</h2>
    <p>Using the design guidelines and knowledge given from prior research, I went over the current doc site (all 550+ pages) and created an outline for a new navigation structure. 
        <img src="https://sonderence.github.io/parkerwright.me/images/contentoutline.png" width="650" height="561.66">
    <p>My Mentor looked over my outline and made a few changes to improve my navigation structure further. We whiteboarded the high-level topic organization for the "Records Management" product, becuase it needed the most revesion. I used the whiteboard to keep track of my work and make notes.
        <img src="https://sonderence.github.io/parkerwright.me/images/rmwhiteboard.jpg" width="650" heigh="809.275">
    <p>I migrated what ended up becoming 422 pages of content in an iterative process and learned as I built out the site in Paligo. I also edited and styled the copy as needed.

<h2>Improved Navigation</h2>
    <div class="nav">
        <p>It now takes less clicks to get to topics. In this example it used to take 9 clicks from the home page to navigate to "Understanding the Classification Rule Operators", but it now takes 6 clicks.</p>

<div class="zendesk">
<h2>Zendesk Integration</h2>
    <p>I proposed that the doc site should be integrated with Zendesk. I created a quick mockup in Figma to showcase what this would look like. This will increasee accessability for the user, since the support portal and doc site will be on one page on Gimmal's website.</p>

<div class="personas">
<h2>Persona Based Interface</h2>
    <p>The idea behind "personas" is the user will have the choice to filter their navigation based on what type of user they are. This will allow even easier navigation and create less noise. <br><br>The 3 categories are: <span><b>End User</b> | </span><span><b>Records Manager</b></span><span> | <b>Administrator</b></span>.<br><br>
        <b>Example:</b> An end user won't have any use for documentation describing how to put in PowerShell code.</p>
