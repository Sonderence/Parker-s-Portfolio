<h2>Project Brief</h2> 
<p>
    <span>Eventbrite</span> is a digital ticketing service that also helps people explore events near them. I find myself using their app the most when I want to find things to do with friends nearby or for an upcoming trip. <span>Eventbrite</span> is used more individually, whereas the collaboration occurs on other platforms, like Facebook or group text. Since experiences are popularly shared with other people, <span>I propose a new feature</span> that allows voting on which event to attend to help reach a group consensus.
</p>
</div>
    
<div class="problem">
<h2>Problem</h2> 
<p>
    Decision-making in groups can be difficult, especially when communicating through messages. Suggestions can get lost in the clutter and it can be a long process to reach a consensus. Users have to keep switching back and forth between researching events on the app and messaging friends, so there is no integration involved where there could be.<br><br>
    My <span>goal</span> is to create a feature in Eventbrite’s app that can ease the group decision making process and increase engagement. My <span>user focus</span> will be on <span>large groups</span> (coworkers, clubs, sports teams, etc.), because they have a tougher time reaching decisions than small groups.</p>
</div>

<div class="reasoning">
<h2>Reasoning</h2>  
<div class="row">

    <div class="column"><b>More Factors Involved</b><br> 
        <p>There are more preferences and requirements in large groups. A small group of friends might all know they want to go to the zoo together when visiting Houston, but preferences are more likely to not align in a large group of acquaintances.<br><br></p></div>
    <div class="column"><b>Paradox of Choice</b><br> 
        <p>When faced with too many options to choose from, many people become “paralyzed” and won’t be able to make up their mind at all.<br><br></p></div>
    <div class="column"><b>Wavering Opinions</b><br>
    <p>In situations like these, most people tend to have ambiguous opinions that can sway one way or another and might not even share what they think at all. The people with stronger opinions lead the pack in a polarizing direction, opposing the middle ground.</div>

    <b>Criteria Voting</b><br> 
        <p>Vote based on certain criteria each user wants out of their experience and the event will be picked based on the most popular criteria.<br><br>
            Creating technology to match the event to the criteria might not be feasible. It would also be complicated and create a mentally strenuous process for the user.<br></p>
        <img src="x.png">
        </div>
    <div class="column"><b>Individual Ranking up to 5</b><br>
    <p>Each user ranks their top 5 events with a certain number of points attached to each rank. The events will then be ranked based on the total points they received from all users in the group.<br><br> 
        It would it would difficult to develop an objective point system and users might want to put two or more events as the same rank.<br></p> 
        <img src="x.png">
        </div>
    <div class="column"><b>Individual Voting with 5 total points</b><br> 
   <p>Each user will have 5 points they can distribute towards the event(s) they want. The event with the most points wins.<br><br> 
       I decided on this idea, because voting would be based on how strong the user’s opinion is on the final decision, while giving all members a voice.</p><br>

<h2>Flowchart</h2>
<p> 
    I mapped out the general process the user goes through to assist in the creation of a low-fidelity design.<br><br>

    I thought about my ideas as I made the flowchart and realized that a long process was a key pain point in all of them. I decided that I should decrease the number of usable points from 5 to 3.<br><br>

    I believe this specific difference would lend itself well to <span>A/B testing</span> at the end, since it’s difficult to understand how much time this process should take and it’s an easy feature to change.<br><br>

<div class="sketches">
<h2>Sketches</h2> 
    <p>I created sketches of my design before moving on to Figma. There were messier drawings before this, because I like to draw as I think through my design.</p>

<div class="wireframes">
<h2>Wireframes</h2> 
<p>Using my sketches, I tweaked and created wireframes of my design that I could use for user research and iterate upon. I couldn’t decide on how navigation should work yet, so I left it out for the time being and explained my ideas verbally to the user.</p>

<h2>User Interviews</h2>
<p>
To learn from other perspectives, I went to the Starbucks at my University to find people for user interviews. After asking questions and walking through my design, I gained valuable insight.<br><br>

<span>“Is there a start and end time to the voting?”</span><br><br>

<span>“The trophy icon looks weird alone.” (said by more than one person.)</span><br><br>

<span>“What if there are certain things that would stop a lot of people from going to a popular event completely, like it’s too far to drive to it?”</span><br><br> 

<span>“Do you need an account to be in the group?”</span><br><br> 

<span>“Are tickets made for the event that got first?”</span><br><br>  


With the new information gathered, I re-worked my wireframes to address the problems brought to my attention.<br><br> 
</p>

<h2>Wireframes - Second Iteration</h2> 
    
<p> 
    <span>“Is there a start and end time to the voting?”</span><br>
    Sometimes seemingly obvious features can be overlooked, so thank you user feedback! There should definitely be a start and end time to the group vote that is set up upon creation.</p><br><br>
    <img src="startend.png">
    
<p>
    <span>“The trophy icon looks weird alone.”</span><br> 
    The ranking icon did look odd alone. I put the new “add member” and “constraints” icons next to it. I also changed the rankings icon since it displays more than just the winner.</p><br><br> 
    <img src="iconnav.png">
   
<p>
    <span>“What if there are certain things that would stop a lot of people from going to an event?”</span><br> 
    At first I felt an event wouldn’t win if too many people couldn’t attend, but social dynamics can be complex. I decided to add a “constraints” page where group members can suggest one constraint each and members can vote up (not down) if they agree. This will make it easier to filter out events that make the rankings.</p><br><br> 
    <img src="constraintswireframe.png">

<p>
    I changed the voting icons to a more minimalistic design.</p><br><br> 
    <img src="votearrows.png">
<p>
    I added the navigation to the group home page on the top left.</p><br><br>

    The group name is now where the picture will be uploaded to make more room.</p><br><br>

        My design should aid decision making, but not act as an absolute choice. The ticket won’t automatically be made, but this gave me an idea for a message to pop up on the home page displaying the winning choice. (The fox is just a fun a bonus.)<br><br>
